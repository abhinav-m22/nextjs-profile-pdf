## A profile page UI in Next.js. 
The profile page UI includes the following components:
1. Profile picture
2. Name
3. Location
4. Company
5. Designation
6. Social icons (Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok)
7. A button that saves the UI as a PDF.
8. The social-icon links are active and clickable in the downloaded PDF.

## Tech Stack Used:
1. Next.js
2. React.js (For components)
3. Tailwind CSS (For Styling)
4. react-pdf for PDF generation



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started


Install the Project in the local system and cd to that directory
Run the following command to install all the dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
npm i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
